# Skill Barter - Skill Swap Platform

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement

Problem Statement 1: Skill Swap Platform â€“ Odoo Hackathon 2025

Build a mini web application that enables users to list their skills and request others in return. The platform should allow users to:

- Create and manage a public or private profile
- Add skills they offer and skills they want to learn
- Search other users by skill
- Send, accept, or reject skill swap requests
- View pending or completed swaps
- Leave feedback or ratings after a successful swap

This platform promotes collaborative learning and community upskilling by facilitating direct peer-to-peer skill exchanges.
